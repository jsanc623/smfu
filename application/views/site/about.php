                    <div id="about">
                        <p>SMFU is the easiest way to shorten and share links from around the web, with a degree of humor.</p>
                        
                        <p>While this is SMFU's second iteration (we've been down for the better part of a year), 
                           you can see that we've been at work building a stronger and faster system.</p>
                           
                        <p>SMFU is available via our <a href="http://smfu.in">website</a> and later I will revamp the
                           Chrome SMFU browser extension. Our API is also open to developers, and documentation will
                           be coming shortly. Along with that, public stats as well as per-user stats will also 
                           be available later.</p>
                           
                        <p>In a nutshell, we're back online...and fairly anonymous...no user visitor data is collected
                           on redirect. That being said, we do strive to minimize spam links and will block all URL
                           blocks that are flagged as spam.</p>
